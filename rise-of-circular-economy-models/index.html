                Circular economy models aim to minimize waste and maximize resource efficiency by keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible through recycling, repurposing, and remanufacturing. Unlike the traditional linear economy, which follows a "take-make-dispose" model, the circular economy seeks to close the loop on resource consumption and waste generation, creating a regenerative and sustainable economic system. From product design and manufacturing to consumption and disposal, circular economy principles drive innovation and reduce environmental impact across industries.
                <br>
                Moreover, the circular economy offers economic opportunities by creating new markets for recycled materials, fostering innovation in product design and business models, and reducing reliance on finite resources. Companies adopting circular economy strategies benefit from cost savings, enhanced brand reputation, and reduced environmental liabilities. By transitioning to circular economy models, we can create a more resilient and sustainable economy that benefits people, the planet, and future generations.
